# Rick and Morty GraphQL API with Next.js

This project demonstrates the use of Next.js with a GraphQL API, specifically the Rick and Morty API. It showcases how to consume the GraphQL API in a Next.js application and highlights the benefits of using GraphQL for data fetching. This is my first approach to the consumption of a GraphQL API.

Developed by **[Jo-Varo](https://github.com/Jo-varo)**. The base of this project is [Fazt Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhvmCldV0HU) and [How to use Apollo Client with Next.js 13](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/how-to-use-apollo-client-with-next-js-13).

## Features
- GraphQL API Consumption: Utilizes the Rick and Morty GraphQL API to fetch data.
- Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Leverages Next.js's SSR capabilities to ensure fast initial page loads.
- Client Site Generation (CSR): Employs   CSR to make real time requests.
- Apollo Client Integration: Uses Apollo Client for advanced state management and caching.
- TypeScript Support: Benefits from TypeScript's static typing for better developer experience.
